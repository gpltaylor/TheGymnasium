    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
        Like a large percentage of the population a gym membership would usually consist of the following
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access to the facilities with no help or support</li>
        <li>Boring repetitive classes</li>
        <li>A unfriendly atmosphere where nobody communicates</li>
        <li>Resistance machines that cause long term injuries</li>
        <li>A programme that you've been completing for the last 12 months</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
