            I've been working at the Gymnasium now for 18 months, I have gained my level 3 Personal Trainer
            qualification 4
            years ago and I’ve been using it ever since.
        </p>

        <p>
            gym gives me the opportunity to express myself during the classes I instruct and the clients I work with one to one.
        </p>

        <p>
            The open plan space and variety of equipment makes my job extremely rewarding. Hopefully fun to the clients that experience my session but at the same time physically challenging.
        </p>

        <p>
            All the members at the gym are a joy to work with, they turn up willing to give 100% knowing that’s what is required to have a successful workout.
